    "text": "I’m Dr Jordi Mateo Fornés, a Lecturer in Computer Science at the University of Lleida (UdL), specializing in Cloud Architecture and Services. I hold a PhD in Cloud Computing, and my work explores methods, paradigms, and solutions for distributed computing environments. I earned my B.S. (2012) and M.S. (2013) in Computer Science from the Escola Politècnica Superior (EPS) at the Universitat de Lleida, where I continue to teach and conduct research.\nMy research spans various domains, including Distributed Systems (Cloud, Fog, Edge, IoT) and High-Performance Computing. Building on these foundational areas, my work also involves knowledge transfer to decision support systems and distributed intelligence in Healthcare, Agriculture, and Energy domains.\nIn my teaching role, I deliver undergraduate courses in Operating Systems and System Administration. These courses provide the theoretical underpinnings and practical competencies to understand and work with modern distributed computing environments. These courses form the backbone of all computing infrastructures, from embedded edge devices to large-scale cloud platforms. Advancements such as kernel optimisation, virtualisation, containerisation, and lightweight architectures are fundamental for achieving performance, scalability, or resilience in the distributed systems. Additionally, I supervise both undergraduate and master’s theses, assisting students in navigating their research projects and developing strong, practical skills in computer science.\nAs an advocate for open-source technologies, I actively promote their use in research and education. Through this blog, I share insights on emerging trends in computer science, along with reflections from my research, teaching, and professional experiences.\nThank you for visiting!"

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nCloud computing is a new paradigm that opens a flexible and financial attractive door for businessand consumers. In recent years, cloud services have reshaped the way business models are planned,saving costs and improving efficiency. There is an exponential growth of cloud solutions available in the public and private sector. This way, cloud services are based on a pay-per-use model, offering resources and service through the Internet. Moreover, the cloud architectures provide many advantages concerning scalability, maintainability and massive data processing. High Performance Computing (HPC) decomposition methods and Operation Research (OR) models integration inside the cloud brings the opportunity to improve the performance and the quality of the cloud services. There are infinite opportunities and challenges for exploiting the capabilities of Decision Support Systems (DSS) inside the cloud. The agribusiness sector can significantly be boost by the consideration of these possibilities."

    "text": "Methods\nQueuing theory and nonlinear programming were combined to model cloud architectures and to develop trade-off policies considering different metrics and ensuring a certain level of quality of service. OR decomposition methods (Benders Decomposition and Lagrangian Decomposition) are improved using HPC paradigms. Cloud services, OR methods and decision support systems are integrated to deliver knowledge from academia to society. Two-stage sStochastic programming was selected to enhance the decision-making process in the agribusiness field. Finally, two different agribusiness applications were designed, deployed and tested on a real cloud platform."

    "section": "Conclusions",
    "text": "Conclusions\nSeveral cloud models and policies were analysed and implemented using different methods and techniques. The results yielded by this thesis provide strong evidence that parallel decomposition methods, such as Lagrangian Decomposition and Benders Decomposition can beat commercial solvers such as CPLEX when dealing with the optimal resolution of real-life stochastic instances. SPOS shows how to orchestrate cloud platforms to deliver knowledge as a service while integrating mathematical solvers in a cloud environment. In a more agroindustrial context, the stochastic model designed around the Chilean dried apple supply chain proof a cost reduction by considering uncertain up to a 6.4%. Finally, a cloud DSS was successfully developed and implemented to assist sow farmers. All the results extracted from this thesis are an essential seed for modelling a much bigger service, with great potential to become a reference in the design of cloud DSS offering all users the possibility of solving any problem, even stochastic models, and also of obtaining detailed and custom results."
