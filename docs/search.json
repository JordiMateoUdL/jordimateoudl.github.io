I hold a PhD in Cloud Computing, and my work explores methods, paradigms, and solutions for distributed computing environments. I earned my B.S. (2012) and M.S. (2013) in Computer Science from the Escola Politècnica Superior (EPS) at the Universitat de Lleida, where I continue to teach and conduct research.\nMy research spans various domains, including Distributed Systems (Cloud, Fog, Edge, IoT) and High-Performance Computing. Building on these foundational areas, my work also involves knowledge transfer to decision support systems and distributed intelligence in Healthcare, Agriculture, and Energy domains.\nIn my teaching role, I deliver undergraduate courses in Operating Systems and System Administration. These courses provide the theoretical underpinnings and practical competencies to understand and work with modern distributed computing environments. These courses form the backbone of all computing infrastructures, from embedded edge devices to large-scale cloud platforms. Advancements such as kernel optimisation, virtualisation, containerisation, and lightweight architectures are fundamental for achieving performance, scalability, or resilience in the distributed systems. Additionally, I supervise both undergraduate and master’s theses, assisting students in navigating their research projects and developing strong, practical skills in computer science.\nAs an advocate for open-source technologies, I actively promote their use in research and education. Through this blog, I share insights on emerging trends in computer science, along with reflections from my research, teaching, and professional experiences.\nThank you for visiting!"

    "text": "Abstract\nCloud computing is a new paradigm that opens a flexible and financial attractive door for businessand consumers. In recent years, cloud services have reshaped the way business models are planned,saving costs and improving efficiency. There is an exponential growth of cloud solutions available in the public and private sector. This way, cloud services are based on a pay-per-use model, offering resources and service through the Internet. Moreover, the cloud architectures provide many advantages concerning scalability, maintainability and massive data processing. High Performance Computing (HPC) decomposition methods and Operation Research (OR) models integration inside the cloud brings the opportunity to improve the performance and the quality of the cloud services. There are infinite opportunities and challenges for exploiting the capabilities of Decision Support Systems (DSS) inside the cloud. The agribusiness sector can significantly be boost by the consideration of these possibilities."

    "text": "Conclusions\nSeveral cloud models and policies were analysed and implemented using different methods and techniques. The results yielded by this thesis provide strong evidence that parallel decomposition methods, such as Lagrangian Decomposition and Benders Decomposition can beat commercial solvers such as CPLEX when dealing with the optimal resolution of real-life stochastic instances. SPOS shows how to orchestrate cloud platforms to deliver knowledge as a service while integrating mathematical solvers in a cloud environment. In a more agroindustrial context, the stochastic model designed around the Chilean dried apple supply chain proof a cost reduction by considering uncertain up to a 6.4%. Finally, a cloud DSS was successfully developed and implemented to assist sow farmers. All the results extracted from this thesis are an essential seed for modelling a much bigger service, with great potential to become a reference in the design of cloud DSS offering all users the possibility of solving any problem, even stochastic models, and also of obtaining detailed and custom results."

    "text": "Background\nPopulation-based cancer registries are crucial for controlling and studying cancer incidence, mortality, and survival. These systems focus on collecting new cancer cases and analyzing their impact in a specific region. In addition, exploring external information sources to complement the data registry allows for the identification of search patterns and correlations in each specific region. This thesis focuses on integrating some databases, such as risk factors and prescription medicines, cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI). This is a term that has been present in the business and social sectors over the last few years. The capacity of artificial intelligence to learn, simulating the human brain, has permitted the automation of the process and decreased the time required. This technique is characterised by an algorithm training process to then decide what the machine has learned. Artificial intelligence algorithms have opened new ways for the analysis, detection, prediction and pattern search of cancer which are explored in this thesis."

Non-supervised machine learning algorithms were used as a tool for detecting patterns of cancer by the different lifestyles of cancer patients. The Multiple Correspondence Analysis algorithm was trained to detect cancer patterns for the most frequent cancers. K-means was implemented for cancer detection among cases of colorectal cancer. Next, epidemiological studies were employed to ensure the validity of the external databases by assessing the association of some risk factors with the occurrence of a second cancer. Additionally, the protective effect of aspirin against certain types of cancer was analyzed, while accounting for relevant risk factors."

It also explores in depth how some risk factors increase the risk of cancer and other functionalities, such as estimates the risk of developing secondary primary cancer. Finally, this thesis explores how to export this knowledge to society through cutting-edge technology. The main outcomes of this thesis highlight a cloud application to assist population cancer registries in analysing cancer incidence and mortality and the use of machine learning algorithms to detect patterns and associations of the factors that may increase the risk of cancer. In this exploration, we have discovered a strong association between colorectal cancer and individuals living in rural populations. However, lung cancer is more common among those living in urban areas. On the other hand, our analysis of the risk of developing secondary primary cancer revealed that certain risk factors, such as smoking and heavy alcohol use, significantly increase the likelihood of developing such cancers. Finally, the results show the protective effect of aspirin against some tumours, taking into account such risk factors as smoking or heavy alcohol use or excess weight."

    "text": "Introduction and Motivation\nThe electric power grid field is undergoing a profound transformation driven by two interconnected trends:\n\nIncreasing uncertainty, driven by the high penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources (RES), such as solar and wind.\nDecentralization of energy production, control, and decision-making, enabled by the adoption of distributed energy resources (DERs), battery storage systems, and electric vehicles (EVs).\n\nThese trends challenge traditional centralized grid paradigms, which are not suitable to handle the growing complexity, variability, and scale of modern power systems. As a result, there is a need for novel computational and architectural approaches that support real-time, scalable, and intelligent decision-making. Hence, this research line integrates distributed continuum computing with modern power systems engineering to address critical challenges in three interrelated areas:\n\nResilience: Ensuring robustness against unpredictable failures and maintaining operational continuity in the presence of uncertainty and volatility. The focus is on how continuum architectures can prevent or contain cascading failures in distributed power grids.\nScalability: Managing real-time coordination and optimization of millions of heterogeneous DERs and controllable loads. The research explores whether graph neural networks (GNNs) or physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) can provide faster, more scalable alternatives to traditional optimization solvers.\nFlexible markets: Adapting to rapidly changing grid conditions and enabling dynamic participation of consumers and prosumers in energy markets. The research aims to investigate what mechanisms are needed to support flexible, real-time electricity markets.\n\nThese pillars are not isolated; they form a mutually reinforcing foundation for a future grid that is resilient, scalable, and responsive. Hence, to support the development and validation of such architectures, the research also targets kernel- and middleware-level innovations for large-scale, distributed power system simulation. These tools will be essential for evaluating new algorithms, control schemes, and market mechanisms under realistic scenarios.\n\n\n\nChallenges and Emerging Trends in Energy Informatics Across the Cloud Continuum"

The goal is to develop a decision support system that can efficiently coordinate the expansion of microgrids while considering uncertainties in demand and generation.\n\n\n\n\n\nP-CoMG: Parallel Decision Support for Power Networks. This was a TFG (Final Degree Project) at the University of Lleida (UdL) in the Distributed Computing Research Group, supervised by Dr. Sambeet Mishra from the University of South-Eastern Norway (USN) and Dr. Jordi Mateo from UdL. The project focused on developing a new parallel decision support system to assist decisions in power networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA multi-agent system approach for optimal microgrid expansion planning under uncertainty\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy-as-a-Service (EaaS)\nThis work examines the organization of microgrids within a local energy market, requiring a framework for efficient decentralized energy operation and system resilience. One practical approach is forming Virtual Power Plants (VPPs), which consolidate distributed generation and storage into a single unit. Smart contracts on blockchain enable automated transactions without central oversight but face challenges due to incomplete supply and demand information.\n\n\n\n\n\nSmart contract formation enabling energy-as-a-service in a virtual power plant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Visits\n\nSergi Lopez, a Lecturer from the University of Lleida (UdL) and member of the Distributed Computing Research Group, visited the University of South-Eastern Norway (USN) for a period of 3 months during his PhD studies in summer 2024. The aim of the visit was to develop oracles for bid validation in local energy markets using various consensus mechanisms. His works includes a comparative study of public-private cross-chain consensus strategies between Local Energy Markets (LEMs) and Distribution System Operators (DSOs).\n\n\n\nOngoing Projects\n\nGraph Neural Networks (GNNs) for Power Systems\nThis project explores the application of GNNs to model power flow in electrical networks. By learning from historical grid data, GNNs can replace conventional solvers, offering faster and more scalable real-time predictions. The research aims to improve adaptability under dynamic grid conditions and support the transition to smarter, data-driven power system operations.\n\n\nKnowledge Graphs for Power Systems\nWe are designing domain-specific knowledge graphs to structure heterogeneous information from the energy domain, such as asset metadata, grid topology, and operational data. These graphs enable advanced reasoning, fault diagnosis, and decision support through semantic enrichment and inference, laying the foundation for explainable AI in power system management.\n\n\nCloud Continuum for Power Systems\nThis initiative investigates distributed intelligence across cloud, fog, and edge layers to support scalable energy management. The focus is on orchestrating real-time decision-making across a cloud continuum using Edge AI and TinyML. The project focuses on system resilience and latency-aware control, which are critical for integrating renewable energy and decentralized resources.\n\n\n\nWorkshops and Seminars\n\n2025 University of Lleida (UdL) Workshop on Distributed Computing and Power Systems: Workshop between the Distributed Computing Research Group at UdL and the University of South-Eastern Norway (USN) to discuss ongoing research, share findings, and explore future collaborations in distributed computing and power systems.
