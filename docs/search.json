    "text": "I’m Dr Jordi Mateo Fornés, a Lecturer in Computer Science at the University of Lleida (UdL), specializing in Cloud Architecture and Services. I hold a PhD in Cloud Computing, and my work explores methods, paradigms, and solutions for distributed computing environments. I earned my B.S. (2012) and M.S. (2013) in Computer Science from the Escola Politècnica Superior (EPS) at the Universitat de Lleida, where I continue to teach and conduct research.\nMy research spans various domains, including Distributed Systems (Cloud, Fog, Edge, IoT) and High-Performance Computing. Building on these foundational areas, my work also involves knowledge transfer to decision support systems and distributed intelligence in Healthcare, Agriculture, and Energy domains.\nIn my teaching role, I deliver undergraduate courses in Operating Systems and System Administration. These courses provide the theoretical underpinnings and practical competencies to understand and work with modern distributed computing environments. These courses form the backbone of all computing infrastructures, from embedded edge devices to large-scale cloud platforms. Advancements such as kernel optimisation, virtualisation, containerisation, and lightweight architectures are fundamental for achieving performance, scalability, or resilience in the distributed systems. Additionally, I supervise both undergraduate and master’s theses, assisting students in navigating their research projects and developing strong, practical skills in computer science.\nAs an advocate for open-source technologies, I actively promote their use in research and education. Through this blog, I share insights on emerging trends in computer science, along with reflections from my research, teaching, and professional experiences.\nThank you for visiting!"

    "text": "The electric power grid field is undergoing a profound transformation driven by two interconnected trends:\n\nIncreasing uncertainty, driven by the high penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources (RES), such as solar and wind.\nDecentralization of energy production, control, and decision-making, enabled by the adoption of distributed energy resources (DERs), battery storage systems, and electric vehicles (EVs).\n\nThese trends challenge traditional centralized grid paradigms, which are not suitable to handle the growing complexity, variability, and scale of modern power systems. As a result, there is a need for novel computational and architectural approaches that support real-time, scalable, and intelligent decision-making. Hence, this research line integrates distributed continuum computing with modern power systems engineering to address critical challenges in three interrelated areas:\n\nResilience: Ensuring robustness against unpredictable failures and maintaining operational continuity in the presence of uncertainty and volatility. The focus is on how continuum architectures can prevent or contain cascading failures in distributed power grids.\nScalability: Managing real-time coordination and optimization of millions of heterogeneous DERs and controllable loads. The research explores whether graph neural networks (GNNs) or physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) can provide faster, more scalable alternatives to traditional optimization solvers.\nFlexible markets: Adapting to rapidly changing grid conditions and enabling dynamic participation of consumers and prosumers in energy markets. The research aims to investigate what mechanisms are needed to support flexible, real-time electricity markets.\n\nThese pillars are not isolated; they form a mutually reinforcing foundation for a future grid that is resilient, scalable, and responsive. Hence, to support the development and validation of such architectures, the research also targets kernel- and middleware-level innovations for large-scale, distributed power system simulation. These tools will be essential for evaluating new algorithms, control schemes, and market mechanisms under realistic scenarios.\n\n\n\nEnergy Informatics Research Line"
