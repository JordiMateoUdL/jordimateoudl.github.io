# Jordi Mateo's Academic Blog

Welcome to my personal academic blog and professional site, built using the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) open-source publishing system. This site serves as a central hub to share my **research**, **teaching materials**, and **thoughts** on topics that drive my work as a lecturer and researcher.

## Requirements

- [Quarto CLI](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)

### Extensions

- [Academic Icons](https://github.com/schochastics/academicons)

## Acknowledgements
This site is inspired by the academic community’s commitment to open science, reproducibility, and knowledge sharing. Built with ❤️ using Quarto and open-source tools.
